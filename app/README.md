# Project: NYC Open Data
### App folder

The App directory contains the app files for the Shiny App (i.e., ui.r and server.r).

In addition, you can also find our css script file named "style.css" inside folder "www"

Notes about how to use the app:

Your first step should be setting up the filter and click the "search" button. Then the maps would show up. The second tab would be interactive with the filtering information (i.e. the information of colleges and universities would show up according to the input from the filter in the first tab). So please try not to play with any tabs or panels before setting up the filter. Once you have done this, feel free to enjoy the app and start your own school hunter in NY!
