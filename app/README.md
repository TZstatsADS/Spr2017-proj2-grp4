# Project: NYC Open Data
### App folder

The App directory contains the app files for the Shiny App (i.e., ui.r and server.r).

In addition, you can also find our css script file named "style.css" as well as other support pictures or files inside folder "www"

Notes about how to use the app:

Your first step should be setting up the filter and click the "search" button. The dafulat option is set to be "None" to show all the collges currently in our data set. After you have clicked the serach buttoon, two maps will appear and the first map will have the schools that fit the criteria  and the second map will be a cluster map to show specific classification of schools. The focus of the two maps are synced, so any moves in the first map will be reflected in the second map. More options are also provided, such as changing the map layout, as well as calculate the distance(provided in the top right of the map). The second tab is a side by side comparison of schools filtered by the criterias in the first tab. Enjoy our app!
